# NOTE: This list aims for core functionality based on the refined modules.
# Commented-out sections are for future consideration or specific deeper implementations.
# Ensure versions are pinned in a production environment (e.g., fastapi==0.100.0).
# For now, unpinned versions are used for broader compatibility during development.
