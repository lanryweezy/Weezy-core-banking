# --- Mock Data Store (to be replaced by proper memory/DB interaction) ---
# This is temporary, to simulate updates that the FastAPI endpoints can see via the main.py's MOCK_ONBOARDING_DB
# In a real system, the agent would update a shared persistent store (DB, Redis stream, etc.)

# A better approach is for the agent to interact with a separate memory module or database.
# For now, we'll assume the main FastAPI app handles the MOCK_ONBOARDING_DB, and agent returns data.
